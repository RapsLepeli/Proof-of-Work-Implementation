# Proof-of-Work-Implementation
Honours Project - Implementation of the Proof of Work consensus algorithm.

## Objectives
This documentaion is used to track the development of a fully functional blockchain system. This will act as a guide and notes for the developer. This documentation might be used as a template for both the user manual and the technical manual. This documentation will be written in Markdown: Here's a link for the basic syntax [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).<br>
# Getting started
Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 can be used. At this point the application is untested on other development enriroments and fucses on windows systems. Below are the recomended system requiements.

- Windows 10 operating system
- Intel core I5 7th gen / AMD 2nd and 3rd Gen CPU’s
- 8 Gb DDR4 Ram
- 120Gb SSD
- Access to the internet 

1. <u>Downloading the repository:</u><br> 
To clone the repository,make sure git is installed and configures and  in command prompt,  `git clone --recursive https://github.com/RapsLepeli/Proof-of-Work-Implementation.git`

2. <u>Confugiring the dependencies</u><br>
open the solution file in Visual Studio. The minimum .Net SDK should be `v4.7.2`

3. ### User Guide: 
    - #### To be added as development carries on
 
# The Plan
  This project aims to implement a Blockchain Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm. A simple blockchain system will be created from scratch to create, validate, and complete transactions. The blockchain system implemented will include a data structure to record the transactions, the PoW consensus algorithm, a transaction, and a simple peer-to-peer network that simulates nodes or computers participating in the transaction; this includes the sender, receiver, and block proposers. 
  
# Deliverables and Componets
These will change and evolve as time goes by
>	**The Distributed Blockchain data structure**: A distributed blockchain data structure. The blockchain data structure is an ordered, back-linked list of blocks containing transactions. It can be stored in a simple database or as a file. A hash generated by the cryptographic hash technique SHA256 on the block header identifies each block. For example, in the “prev block hash” field of the block header, each block refers to a preceding block called the parent block . 
SHA256 stands for Secure hash algorithm with a length of 256 bits. It was developed by the US’s National Security Agency in 2001 and is known as a one-way cryptographic function. This means it can encrypt data but not decrypt it back to its original form. Each block contains the previous hash block and its hash . A single block also contains a timestamp of when it was created so that all blocks in the chain are placed chronologically. Before a block is added to the blockchain, it is verified by other participants in the system. This ledger records all transactions in this system; only a single instance exists. The figure below shows what a general blockchain data structure looks like

>
>	**A usable Transaction entity.**: A transaction. Refers to the action of transferring funds from one participant to another. A Transaction consists of the amount(can be Bitcoin, Rapscoin, or just plain money) transferred, the payer and the payee. 
>
>	**A simple functional Peer-to-Peer(P2P) network:**:	A Peer-to-Peer network. Message passing on a blockchain network occurs over a peer-to-peer (P2P) network; P2P is a well-known network topology. P2P refers to a decentralised topology where nodes collaborate to share resources and services without a central authority to coordinate the processes . Each participant is a wallet, and this wallet defines the participant’s identity. Each wallet has a public key(for receiving money) and a private key(for spending money). The Pubic-Private key pair is generated using a hashing technique called RSA(Rivest-Shamir-Adleman). Unlike SHA256, this full encryption algorithm can encrypt and decrypt data if one has the proper key .
To encrypt data, a public key is used. It converts the data into ciphertext, an unreadable version of the original data. The corresponding private key can fully decrypt the data back to its original form. However, the Pubic-Private key pair creates a digital signature in this instance. Instead of encrypting the data(Transaction), a hash of that data is created and sign the hash using a private key. Others can then verify the data by using the public key of the person who initiated it to check if it is valid. This means if by any chance another participant tempers with transaction data, verification will not work as the transaction is untrustworthy. This means no one can temper the transaction message since it was signed. The wallet can receive money and spend/send money. The developed simple P2P network simulates how it would function in a blockchain system. The figure below shows how a general P2P network looks like

>
>	**A Functional Proof-of-Work Consensus algorithm.**: A consensus algorithm: Proof-of-Work (PoW) is the mechanism of choice for most cryptocurrencies  and in this project. The algorithm will verify transactions and add blocks to the blockchain data structure. This consensus forces each new block to go through a mining process, where a difficult mathematical challenge is solved to confirm that the block is valid. Once this problem has been solved, it is effortless to verify. Multiple nodes/participants compete to solve this challenge, which works like a lottery. The winner of the lottery gets rewards for solving the complex problem. This process is very resource intensive and inefficient and takes a long time to complete. The problem states that:  find a hash for this block, and this hash must at least start with five zeros or any number. The only way to find this is through brute force and multiple hash computations. The system or the tester automatically decides the problem’s difficulty. The hash is calculated using the MD5(Message-Digest) Algorithm. It is very similar to the SHA256 technique but faster and only 128 bits in length. The figure below shows the results of PoW, where the correct block proposer solves a hash calculation before other network participants.

>	**A simple Minimal interface.** The interface should allow the user to set the number of network nodes, start a transaction and display notifications when transactions are completed or created.

## <u>The Dstributed Blockchain data structure</u><br>

A distributed blockchain data structure. The blockchain data structure can be defined as an ordered, back-linked list of blocks containing transactions. It can be stored in a simple database or as a file. A hash-generated cryptographic hash technique on the block header identifies each block. For example, in the "prior block hash" field of the block header, each block refers to a preceding block called the parent block . This ledger will be used to record all transactions in this system.
