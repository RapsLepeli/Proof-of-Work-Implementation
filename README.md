Honours Project - Implementation of the Proof of Work consensus algorithm.

## Objectives
This documentaion is used to track the development of a fully functional blockchain system. This will act as a guide and notes for the developer. This documentation might be used as a template for both the user manual and the technical manual. This documentation will be written in Markdown: Here's a link for the basic syntax [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).<br>
